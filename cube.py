#Write a program in cube.py that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cube’s surface area
# as output. For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should
# describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode
# algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately.
# After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

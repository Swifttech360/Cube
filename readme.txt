OVERVIEW
    This is a program that gets a cube sidelength as a user input,
  then outputs the total surface area of the theoretical cube.

PSEUDOCODE
  Loop program untill a "break" occurs
  Get cube side length as a string
  Break if the user inputs "end"
  Try to convert user input to floating point number
  Restart loop if any error (like a Value Error) occurs after sending a short error message
  Calculate the surface area of the cube, and initialize new value as "surfaceArea"
  Exclude the remainder if it's equal to zero
  Print the cube's calculated surface area, along with the formula used to get it.
  Loop
